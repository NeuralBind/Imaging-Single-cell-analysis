# Imaging_Single-cell_analysis
mRNA spot detection pipeline and Growth curves based on cell-segmentation. [FISH-Quant](https://github.com/fish-quant/big-fish) and [Napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) in the same environment required to run the notebooks.

Scripts:
1. Personalised mRNA Detection-Pipeline and colocalization analysis using FISH-Quant Library for 2-channels, and single cell expression analysis; mRNA_detection_colocalization_pipeline
2. Growth curves based on input of 2D segmentation of brightfield - live imaging of multiple positions (at the same timepoints, doing a single and mean representation) during carbon switch in microfluidics (Growth plots.ipynb)
4. Fluigent Oxygen Software protocols for fixation and hybridization duringr RNA FISH of yeast in microfluidics set-up.
