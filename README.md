# Imaging_Single-cell_analysis
mRNA spot detection pipeline and Growth curves based on cell-segmentation. [FISH-Quant](https://github.com/fish-quant/big-fish) and [Napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) in the same enviroment required to run the notebooks.

1. Personalised Detection-Pipeline using FISH-Quant Library for 2-channels, and single cell expression analysis (Double_channel_mRNAdetection.ipynb)
2. Growth curves based on input of 2D segmentation of brightfield - live imaging of multiple positions (at the same timepoints) during carbon switch in microfluidics (Growth plots.ipynb)
3. Evaluation of results and draft script for analysis (Spot_detection_Sc_FISH.ipynb) with utilizing a script in the src file to translate segmentations in case of drift
4. Fluigent Oxygen Software protocol, for RNA FISH in yeast.
