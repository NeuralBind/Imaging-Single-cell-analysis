# Imaging-Single-cell-analysis
mRNA spot detection pipeline and Growth curves based on cell-segmentation. [FISH-Quant](https://github.com/fish-quant/big-fish) and [Napari](https://github.com/napari/napari)  required to run the notebooks.

1. Personalised Detection-Pipeline using FISH-Quant Library for 2-channels, and single cell expression analysis (Double_channel_mRNAdetection.ipynb)
2. Growth curves based on 2D segmentation of brightfield- live imaging during carbon switch in microfluidics (Growth plots.ipynb)
